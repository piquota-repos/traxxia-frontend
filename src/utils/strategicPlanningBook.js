const strategicPlanningBook = "<Strategic Planning Book>**Introduction**\\n\\nThe author of this book returned to Peru in 2010 after working abroad for many years. Upon their return, they found a country with economic optimism and electoral tension. However, they soon noticed a lack of urgency in company boards and management, with leaders often believing they had plenty of time to implement changes. The author also observed that many businessmen believed their fate was determined by external factors beyond their control.\\n\\nThe author identified four key issues in Peruvian businesses:\\n\\n1. **Lack of urgency**: Company leaders often lacked a sense of urgency, unlike their counterparts in developed markets who face greater pressure from boards, shareholders, and competitors.\\n2. **Over-reliance on external factors**: Many businessmen believed their success or failure was largely determined by external variables, such as commodity prices or government policies.\\n3. **Strong opinions based on limited information**: Business leaders often held strong opinions based on limited data and prejudices, rather than thorough analysis.\\n4. **Tactical and qualitative plans with poor follow-up**: Companies often had vague strategic plans with little attention to customer needs, competition, or future disruptions.\\n\\nIn contrast, the author had learned six key lessons from their experience working with companies abroad:\\n\\n1. **Sense of urgency**: Successful companies have a sense of urgency, driven by economic incentives and pressure from stakeholders.\\n2. **Changes create opportunities**: Crises and disruptions can be opportunities for growth and transformation.\\n3. **Biases are questioned with extreme analytical depth**: The best companies question their biases and assumptions through thorough analysis.\\n4. **In-depth awareness of customers**: Successful companies have a deep understanding of their customers' needs and behaviors.\\n5. **The best transformations are focused on the stakeholder**: Companies should prioritize the needs of all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and local communities.\\n6. **The best transformations have a solid strategic plan and disciplined execution**: Successful companies have a clear strategic plan and a disciplined approach to execution.\\n\\nThe book is structured into three sections: understanding the current situation of local companies, explaining what a good strategy is, and providing practical guidance on developing and executing a business strategy. The author uses data from 72 non-financial companies and 75 non-financial companies, as well as surveys of Peruvian and foreign companies, to inform their analysis.\\n\\n**PART ONE: CURRENT SITUATION OF PERU**\\n\\n**CHAPTER ONE: THE ILLUSION OF RETURNS**\\n\\nThe author reflects on their experience working with companies in Peru and abroad, highlighting the importance of measuring business success through returns on investment. They note that many companies focus on revenue growth or profit growth, but neglect to consider the capital invested.\\n\\nThe author identifies three key reasons why Peruvian companies have been destroying value for shareholders:\\n\\n1. **Low margins**: Peruvian companies have lower gross margins than their international competitors, due to a population with lower per capita income and higher sales costs.\\n2. **High invested capital**: Peruvian companies invest rapidly in fixed assets and working capital, but often fail to consider the invested capital when measuring success.\\n3. **Slow reaction time**: Peruvian companies take longer to react to changes in the market, unlike their international competitors who adjust their operating and administrative expenses more quickly.\\n\\nThe author concludes that while the average return on invested capital (ROIC) of Peruvian companies may appear high, it has been declining over the past 12 years, and that removing the mining sector from the analysis reveals that Peruvian companies have consistently destroyed shareholder value.\\n\\nThe best indicators to measure returns, according to the author, are:\\n\\n1. **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)**\\n2. **ROE (Return on Equity)**\\n3. **ROA (Return on Assets)**\\n4. **Economic Profit**\\n5. **EVA (Economic Value Added)**\\n\\nThese indicators consider annual flows and investment, and can be easily compared to the cost of capital. The author recommends using these indicators to measure shareholder value and identify areas for improvement.\\n\\n**CHAPTER TWO: THE BUSINESS PORTFOLIO DOES NOT MATTER**\\n\\nThe author notes that the business portfolio of a company is not the only factor that determines its success. They provide an example of a company that has a high-margin business unit, but also has a low-return business unit that requires less capital. The author argues that the company should focus on the return on invested capital (ROIC) rather than just the margin.\\n\\nThe author identifies three key reasons why Peruvian companies have poor financial performance:\\n\\n1. **Industries with low international returns**: Some industries in Peru, such as construction materials and electricity, have low international returns.\\n2. **Industries and companies with low performance**: Many Peruvian industries and companies have low performance compared to their international counterparts.\\n3. **Focus on optimizing the business unit, not the portfolio**: Peruvian companies tend to focus on optimizing individual business units rather than reviewing and restructuring their overall portfolio.\\n\\nThe author concludes that Peruvian companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns. They also need to develop a sense of urgency and question their biases and assumptions in order to make informed decisions.\\n\\nThe best indicators to measure returns, according to the author, are:\\n\\n1. **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)**\\n2. **ROE (Return on Equity)**\\n3. **ROA (Return on Assets)**\\n4. **Economic Profit**\\n5. **EVA (Economic Value Added)**\\n\\nThese indicators consider annual flows and investment, and can be easily compared.\\n\\n**Chapter Three: Neither Where Nor How**\\n\\nThe author identifies two key problems in Peruvian companies: lack of precision in defining \\\"where to compete\\\" and lack of differentiation. Many companies try to implement too many strategies at the same time, instead of focusing on one or two. Companies that prefer to achieve differentiation through customer service are not being successful. Companies also forget the importance of becoming differentiated due to cost, despite living in a country with a high percentage of low-revenue consumers.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* The best indicators to measure returns are ROIC, ROE, ROA, Economic Profit, and EVA.\\n* Companies need to define \\\"where to compete\\\" and focus on one or two strategies at a time.\\n* Differentiation is key, and companies can achieve it through costs, customer service, or other variables.\\n\\n**Chapter Four: Forget About Intuition (At Least For Now)**\\n\\nThe chapter discusses the importance of avoiding intuition-based decision-making, particularly in complex and high-value decisions. The author cites Daniel Kahneman's work on System1 (intuitive) and System2 (analytical) decision-making processes. System1 is prone to cognitive biases, which can lead to poor decisions. The author provides examples of common biases, including halo bias, emotional biases, excessive confidence bias, confirmation bias, anchorage, sunk cost bias, group thinking, aversion to loss, and status quo bias.\\n\**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* The best indicators to measure returns are ROIC, ROE, ROA, Economic Profit, and EVA.\\n* Companies need to define \"where to compete\" and focus on one or two strategies at a time.\\n* Differentiation is key, and companies can achieve it through various means.\\n* Intuition-based decision-making can lead to poor decisions, particularly in complex and high-value situations.\\n* Cognitive biases, such as limited information, can significantly impact decision-making in Peruvian companies.\\n* Value-creating companies tend to use System2 decision-making, which is more analytical and reflective.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\n* A survey of 92 companies found that value-creating companies tend to be more analytical and reflective in their decision-making processes.\\n* The survey also found that limited information is a significant bias in Peruvian companies, particularly in those that destroy value.\\n* Companies that create value tend to be more satisfied with the analytical depth of their strategic planning.\\n**Part One: WHAT’S A GOOD STRATEGY?**\\n\\n**Chapter Five: How to Create a Good Strategy**\\nA good strategy is a set of actions that enable focusing the organization’s resources to achieve sustained profitability superior to that of the competitors. A good strategy should have seven key features:\\n\\n1. A vision and challenging goals to drive the organization to reach relevant results.\\n2. It is based on facts, as the consequence of an analytical planning process.\\n3. It is focused on very few strategic principles.\\n4. It is custom-made for each organization.\\n5. It establishes clear principles for resource distribution for the most important initiatives of the organization.\\n6. It is tough in defining the route of the organization in industrial turmoil.\\n7. It draws a long list of initiatives of what will not be done.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* The best indicators to measure returns are ROIC, ROE, ROA, Economic Profit, and EVA.\\n* Companies need to define \"where to compete\" and focus on one or two strategies at a time.\\n* Differentiation is key, and companies can achieve it through various means.\\n* Intuition-based decision-making can lead to poor decisions, particularly in complex and high-value situations.\\n* Cognitive biases, such as limited information, can significantly impact decision-making in Peruvian companies.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\n* A survey of92 companies found that value-creating companies tend to be more analytical and reflective in their decision-making processes.\\n* The survey also found that limited information is a significant bias in Peruvian companies, particularly in those that destroy value.\\n* Companies that create value tend to be more satisfied with the analytical depth of their strategic planning.\\n* A good strategy should respond to the most relevant questions the shareholders and senior management might have regarding the direction to follow.\\n* There are two main types of strategies: business unit strategy and corporate strategy.\\n**Chapter Six: Business Unit Strategy**\\n\\nTo design a good business strategy, three questions need to be answered: where to compete, how to compete, and how to achieve the best business potential.\\n\\n* **Where to Compete**: Identify market segments that are large, profitable, and have limited competition. The core business axis should be defined, and then adjoining positions for expansion should be found.\\n* **How to Compete**: Three types of strategies according to Porter: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. A good definition of \"how to compete\" makes it possible to attack a segment of target customers and retain a high percentage of the segment by serving it better than the competition.\\n* **How to Achieve the Best Business Potential**: Evaluate the full potential of the business by assessing its market share, profitability, and acceptance of products.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n* Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology in all business areas, producing fundamental changes in the manner that businesses operate and deliver customer value.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\n* A survey of92 companies found that value-creating companies tend to be more analytical and reflective in their decision-making processes.\\n* Companies that create value tend to be more satisfied with the analytical depth of their strategic planning.\\n* Successful business models include Enalta of Banco de Crédito and Segurosimple.com.\\n* Digital transformation examples include Domino's, Capital One, and Walgreens.\\n**Chapter Seven: Where to Go? To Which Countries Should I Expand?**\\n\\nWhen expanding internationally, companies should consider the following best practices:\\n\\n* Start from a robust core business with a strong market share and scaling.\\n* Seek local efficiency by taking advantage of their scale.\\n* Execute a focused expansion, one step at a time.\\n* Scale the entry into the new country.\\n* Carry out a successful execution.\\n* Adapt the business model to the local context.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n* International expansion can be a good growth strategy, but it requires careful planning and execution.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\n* A survey of 92 companies found that value-creating companies tend to be more analytical and reflective in their decision-making processes.\\n* Companies that create value tend to be more satisfied with the analytical depth of their strategic planning.\\n* Successful business models include Enalta of Banco de Crédito and Segurosimple.com.\\n* Examples of successful international expansions include Tesco and Coca-Cola FEMSA.\\n\\n**Best Practices for International Expansion**\\n\\n* Start from a robust core business with a strong market share and scaling.\\n* Seek local efficiency by taking advantage of their scale.\\n* Execute a focused expansion, one step at a time.\\n* Scale the entry into the new country.\\n* Carry out a successful execution.\\n* Adapt the business model to the local context.\\n**Chapter Eight: Corporate Strategy**\\n\\nA corporate strategy is useful when the organization has two or more business lines. It focuses on analyzing four dimensions:\\n\\n* **Aspiration**: Determine the returns to be expected from the business units and from the organization as a whole.\\n* **Portfolio**: Evaluate whether to acquire, maintain, or divest businesses to create a coherent business portfolio.\\n* **Parenting Advantage**: Define what functions or services are rendered at the level of each business unit and which are rendered to the units at a corporate center.\\n* **Capital**: Determine how much capital must be assigned to the different businesses, how it will be financed, and how it will be managed.**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n* Corporate strategy is essential for organizations with multiple business units to create a coherent business portfolio and a value-added corporate center.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\n* A survey of92 companies found that value-creating companies tend to be more analytical and reflective in their decision-making processes.\\n* Companies that create value tend to be more satisfied with the analytical depth of their strategic planning.\\n* Successful business models include Enalta of Banco de Crédito and Segurosimple.com.\\n* Examples of successful international expansions include Tesco and Coca-Cola FEMSA.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Corporate Strategy**\\n\\n* Determine an aggressive aspiration, but one that is feasible to carry out.\\n* Assess whether the portfolio needs to be restructured.\\n* Develop central capacities of parenting advantage that may be transferred to the portfolio companies to ensure that the total organization value will be higher than the sum of the parts.\\n* Redefine allotment of capital decisions.\\n**Part Three: How to Develop and Execute a Successful Strategy**\\n\\n### Chapter Nine: The Five Keys to Strategic Planning\\n\\nPeruvian companies often make mistakes in their strategic planning processes, such as having qualitative and non-aggressive aspirations, making strategic decisions without sufficient analysis, developing strategies with a small group of executives, and having infrequent planning episodes. Value-creating companies tend to have more aggressive aspirations, be more inclusive, develop greater analytical depth, be more creative, and encourage greater debate.\\n\\nThe five best practices for successful planning are:\\n\\n1. **More aggressive aspirations**: Value-creating companies have a rigorous process for setting up aspirations and goals, focus on value creation, and have a more distant horizon.\\n2. **More inclusive**: Value-creating companies involve more directors and managers in the planning process and assign more internal and external resources.\\n3. **More analytical depth and insight**: Value-creating companies develop more robust business strategies by focusing on a smaller number of strategies, formulating strategic questions, and conducting in-depth quantitative analysis.\\n4. **More creativity**: Value-creating companies incorporate creativity into their strategic planning process by searching for opportunities among customers, finding unattended spaces by the competition, and identifying untapped distinctive competencies.\\n5. **More frequent debates**: Value-creating companies promote more discussion of their strategies through more frequent planning and having a formal forum throughout the year to continue discussing strategies.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n* Digital transformation and international expansion can be good growth strategies, but they require careful planning and execution.\\n* Corporate strategy is essential for organizations with multiple business units to create a coherent business portfolio and a value-added corporate center.\\n* Value-creating companies tend to have more aggressive aspirations, be more inclusive, develop greater analytical depth, be more creative, and encourage greater debate in their strategic planning processes.\\n### Chapter Ten: Time to Start\\n\\nThe best companies ensure a disciplined execution of their strategies by working in three dimensions: focus, resource alignment, and leadership. They focus on a few significant initiatives, prioritize productivity over growth, and apply Theory E (economic value) and Theory O (organizational capabilities) in a balanced manner. They also establish a governance structure with clear leaders, define decision rights, and promote a culture that supports execution.\\n\\nTo achieve resource alignment, companies should:\\n\\n1. Establish a governance structure with clear leaders\\n2. Define decision rights\\n3. Promote a culture that supports execution\\n\\nLeadership plays a crucial role in strategy execution, and continuous communication is essential to ensure that the leadership message reaches all employees. The budget should be structured around \"value trees\" and aligned with financial accounts to ensure rigorous budget follow-up.\\n\\nA coherent and consistent execution process is critical, and value-creating companies tend to have a greater sense of process coherence and consistency. To ensure efficient execution, companies should:\\n\\n1. Establish a recurring follow-up process with a coherent project management office (PMO)\\n2. Use correct indicators and incentives, such as the OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic principles, and establishes clear principles for resource distribution.\\n* Digital transformation and international expansion can be good growth strategies, but they require careful planning and execution.\\n* Corporate strategy is essential for organizations with multiple business units to create a coherent business portfolio and a value-added corporate center.\\n* Value-creating\\n**Annex 1: Questionnaire to Evaluate the Capacity to Formulate and Execute a Strategy Successfully**\\n\\nThe questionnaire consists of 16 questions, divided into two sections: strategy formulation and strategy execution. The questions assess the company's ability to formulate and execute a successful strategy, including aspects such as aggressive goals, competitive advantage, strategic planning, and execution follow-up.**Annex 2: How to Conduct a Strategic Planning Process**\\n\\nThe strategic planning process has two stages: strategy formulation and strategy review. The strategy formulation stage consists of three phases:\\n\\n1. Analysis: Compile information to define where and how to compete, using the \"6 Cs\" framework (Costs, Community, Context, Competitors, Customers, and Competencies).\\n2. Definition of aspiration, where, how, and full potential: Define the company's aspiration, identify segments/battlefields, and define a business model to differentiate from the competition.\\n3. Strategy development: Define the mission and vision, objectives, and initiatives to comply with the strategy.\\n\\nThe strategy review stage involves a quarterly review of the strategy, focusing on specific elements such as market penetration, costs, and progress towards goals.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Peruvian companies lack a sense of urgency and rely too much on external factors.\\n* Companies need to focus on creating value for shareholders by optimizing their portfolios and investing in industries with high returns.\\n* A good strategy has a challenging vision and goals, is factual, focuses on a few strategic\\n\\\"### Navigating the Modern Business Landscape: Embracing Agile Strategic Planning\\n \\nIn today’s volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, traditional strategic planning is no longer sufficient.
